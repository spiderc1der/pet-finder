      <p>Below are the pets currently added to the database:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2008 (all pets)</li>
        <li>2009 (all pets)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        New pets are being added daily! Each year has ~800-1,200 pets. Please
        check back soon if your pet is not included in the groups that have
        already been added &#9786;

      <p>
        Some pets have multiple in-between "baby" stages. The database is set up
        to record only one per pet- in the event of multiple stages, the
        middle-most one is chosen. To see all stages of a pet's growth, please
        see the linked archive page.

        Most pet & litter names are sourced from the
        <a href="https://wiki.chickensmoothie.com/Category:Pet_and_Litter_Names"
          >Wiki's name guide</a
        >! Pets without names are assigned descriptive names based on their
        appearance.

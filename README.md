# Pet Finder
Pet Finder (http://www.whatpetdidiget.com) is an online tool for the 2008 virtual pet forum game "Chicken Smoothie" (https://www.chickensmoothie.com). Similar to Neopets, Chicken Smoothie allows users to "adopt" pets, represented by images. On December 18th, old pets are re-released. These re-released pets use the same images as their original counterparts, but do not display their original release dates. This can cause confusion amongst newer players who are unfamiliar with older pets and have no choice but to manually search through the pet archives in order to find when their pet is from. Pet Finder allows users to simply copy & paste the pet's image address into the input bar and get its information quickly.

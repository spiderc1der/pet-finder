        <p>300+ pets are being added daily! Each year has ~800-1,200 pets. Please check back soon if your pet is not included in the groups that have already been added &#9786; </p>

        <p>Some pets have multiple in-between "baby" stages. The database is set up to record only one per pet- 
          in the event of multiple stages, the middle-most one is chosen. To see all stages of a pet's growth, 
          please see the linked archive page.</p>

        <p>Most pet & litter names were sourced from the 
          <a href="https://wiki.chickensmoothie.com/Category:Pet_and_Litter_Names">Wiki's name guide</a>! Pets
            without names were assigned descriptive names based on their appearance.

            welcome! this is a tool for the virtual pet Chicken Smoothie, that
            allows you to find the release date of a pet from its image. no longer
            will you have to wonder what pet you received on December 18th â˜º
            simply copy and paste the image address of your pet 
            (without dress-up items!) into the box below and click/press enter.
            
            <br><br>
            NOTE: this is a work in progress! currently, the only pets in the 
            database are 2008 dogs. all pets from 2008-2017 will be added before
            Dec 18th 2023!

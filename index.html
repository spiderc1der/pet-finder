        <p>Welcome! This is a tool for the virtual pet game "Chicken Smoothie", that allows you to find the release date of a pet from its image. No longer will you have to wonder what pet you received on December 18th! Simply copy and paste the image address of your pet (without dress-up items!) into the box below and press enter.</p>
